/* --- Object Oriented Programming -- 
in PHP is often abbreviated to OOP. -
it is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs.

/*
  From PHP5 onwards you can write PHP in either a procedural or object oriented way. 
  OOP consists of classes that can hold "properties" and "methods". Objects can be created from classes.

  // when a method is called, it is called on an object.
  // Methods are defined using the function keyword followed by the method name and a pair of parentheses
  // They are used to perform actions on the properties of the class.
  // Setter method is used to set the value of a private property.
  // function setName() {
  //   $this->name = $name;
  // }
  /* Getter method is used to get the value of a private property.
   -> if a property is public we access it directly like $user->email
    but if it is private we need to use a getter method to access it like $user->getName()
     We use getter methods to access private properties from outside the class.
     They include the prefix 'get' followed by the property name with the first letter capitalized.
     Most IDEs can auto-generate getter and setter methods for you.
